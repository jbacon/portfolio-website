            Advancements in Web APIs give rise to single-page applications (SPA).
		</Typography>
        <br />
        <Typography variant="h2">What is SPA?</Typography>
        <Typography>
            Traditionally, navigating between web pages causes complete rending of a entire page's HTML content.
            More often than not, only part of a page's content typically changes between navigation.
            Inadvertently, and often times... headers, footers, menus, and titles are all re-rendered unnecessarily.
            So we must ask, why should the entire page reload just to render partial content?
            SPAs address this concern by using modern browser Javascript APIs to perform page modifications (DOM manipulations) on-the-fly.
            Browser support for asynchronous execution, events, listeners, etc, all make the DOM dynamic and reactive.
            Modern websites are made more effective thanks to SPA architecture.
            That said, even with great tooling from the likes of Google, Facebook, and Microsoft, SPAs are easier said than done...
            Maintaining speed, state, history, and events is a programmatic challenge.
            Frameworks have risen to the occasion and offer assistance to the aspiring web developer.
            Let's all avoid making our own home-cooked Javascript spaghetti.<br />

        <Typography variant="h2">Framework Hell</Typography>
        <Typography>
            With the increased difficulty of building SPAs, frameworks have risen to fill a void.
            But choose wisely; that snazzy new framework could very well be tomorrow's technical debt.
		    <br />
            There are many to choose from:
        </Typography>
        <ul>
            <li>react</li>
            <li>angular</li>
            <li>vue</li>
            <li>ember</li>
            <li>knockout</li>
            <li>polymer</li>
            <li>backbone</li>
            <li>flux</li>
        </ul>
        <Typography>
            <br />
            Has the native browser API failed us?
            Before starting this blog website, I was caught in the framework nether.
            Critical to choosing a architecture is thorough understanding of the direction of the modern web.
            Choosing cutting-edge tools that don't not reach wide-spread adoption is a real bummer (thanks Web Components).
            It and should be noted, eventually we will run out of acronyms: SSR, CSR, MVC, MVU, MVI, Flux, Redux, SPA, MPA...
            If you don't understand the high-level trade-offs of each technique, architecture, or tool you will succumb to the whim of the next popular buzz-word.
            <br />
            Criteria for Choosing Front-End Framework:
        </Typography>
        <ul>
                <li>Static Hosting</li>
                <li>Single Page</li>
                <li>Event Driven</li>
                <li>Lightweight</li>
                <li>Reactive</li>
                <li>Data Binding</li>
                <li>URL Routing</li>
        </ul>
        <Typography>
            <br />
            Component driven architecture is clearly the prevailing theme.
            For this blog I decided to use React in combination with Material UI. As much as I did love good old <Link href='http://vanilla-js.com/' target='_blank'>VanillaJS</Link>.
            Non-the-less, the challenges of managing state, data, and events in VanillaJS are not simple, and conventions are not concisely defined.
            React allows me to build reactive components, manage state, and develop quickly.
