# Markdown To React
Today's post we walk-through how to import markdown into a React app.

### Background
Writing Markdown is far easier than writing JSX, and it's especially handy when blogging.
This site, initially built using pure JSX, now supports articles written in either Markdown or JSX.
Let's make life easier, and write Markdown.

### Requirements
- Markdown Component
- Styled Markdown Component
- Dynamic Import Markdown File(s)

### Packages Used
- npm: [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown)
- npm: [react-highlight](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-highlight)
- npm: [remark-gfm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/remark-gfm)


### Markdown Component
Simple usage example of [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown)
```jsx
import ReactMarkdown from 'react-markdown';

const MyMarkdown = (props) => {
    return <ReactMarkdown source={props.markdown} />
};
```
Simple enough, `source` is the markdown in plain text. All conversions from markdown, to html, to react are handled in safe and secure ways.
There are many available properties on this component library, which you may find helpful.

### Markdown Dynamic Importer
The complicated part...
```jsx
const MyMarkdownImporter = (props) => {
    const [markdown, setMarkdown] = React.useState("");

    React.useEffect(() => {
        var asyncFunction = async () => {
            try {
                const importResult = await import(`../blogs/`+props.route)
                const result = await fetch(importResult.default)
                const text = await result.text()
                setMarkdown(text)
            } catch (e) {
                console.log(e)
                throw Error("Failed to fetch markdown file")
            }
        }
        asyncFunction()
    }, [props]);

    return <MyMarkdown markdown={markdown} />
};
```
Markdown files cannot be `imported` directly as text without making crummy WebPack configurations. This is especially troubling if running a unejected CRA.
The code above demonstrates how to `fetch` Markdown as plain text, using the resource `url` provided by our `import` result.
However, we're not out of the water yet, unfortunately `import` cannot work on truly dynamically resources, therefore it must be prefixed with a `hard-coded` path. You can read about dynamic imports here: [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/api/module-methods/#dynamic-expressions-in-import)

### Styled Markdown Component
Default html generated by react-markdown, while functional, probably doesn't fit into your React applications design. This can be solved by custom renderers
```jsx
const MyStyledMarkdown = (props) => {
    return <ReactMarkdown
        renderers={{ // https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown#appendix-b-node-types
            heading: props => <Typography style={{ paddingTop: (30-props.level*3) }} variant={"h"+(props.level+1)} {...props} />,
            paragraph: props => <Typography {...props} />,
            link: props => <Link2 {...props} />,
            code: ({ language, value }) => <Highlight className={language} children={value} />,
            inlineCode: props => <code style={{ background: "#232323" }} {...props} />
        }}
        plugins={[[gfm, { singleTilde: false }]]}
        source={props.markdown} />
};
```
The `renderers` property allows us to override the generated html components. This blog uses `material-ui`, so in order to achieve uniform design, I overrode the different renderer node types that I needed.

## Conclusion
That's all it takes to render Markdown in your React app. Markdown files can be conveniently sourced in git along with the rest of your blog static site content.I hope this article was helpful! Thanks for stopping by. Leave me a comment below.
