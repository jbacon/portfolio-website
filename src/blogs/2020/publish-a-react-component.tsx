        <Typography variant="h2">How To Publish<br />React Components</Typography>
        <Typography>
        <br/>
        So you built a nifty component and want to share it with the world..<br/>
        or maybe re-use across projects. Either way, you need a efficient means of publication.<br/>
        Many 3rd party solutions do exist (see <Link href='https://bit.dev/' target="_blank">bit.dev</Link>); but this guide explores an simple strategy using NPM.<br/>
        <br/>
        In this tutorial we will walk through project configurations for hosting a single component, and here are our requirements:
        </Typography>
        <ul>
            <li>Good Dev Experience: Create React App</li>
            <li>Single Repo: Via GitHub</li>
            <li>Live Working Demo: GitHub Pages</li>
            <li>Tests: Jest</li>
            <li>CI/CD: Travis</li>
            <li>Public Hosting: NPM</li>
        </ul><br/>
        <Typography variant="h4">Create React App</Typography>
        <Typography>
        Even though the component is not a fully fledge app, we still use CRA to provision our project, which ramps up a live working demo.<br/>
        </Typography>
        <Highlight language="bash" content=
{`npm install -g create-react-app
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start`} />
        <Typography>
        The default project will need minor tweaks..<br/>
        <br/>
        First, add the following to <b>package.json</b>
        </Typography>
        <Highlight language="json" content=
{`"main": "build-component/index.js",
"module": "build-component/index.js",
"private": false,
"homepage": ".",
"publishConfig": {
    "access": "public"
},
"repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/jbacon/react-component-progress-indicator"
}`} />
        <Typography>
        Replacing <b>repository.url</b> with your projects repo.<br/>
        <br/>
        Also inside <b>package.json</b>, add a new <b>script</b> called <b>build-component</b> containing the following command:<br/>
        </Typography>
        <Highlight language="bash"  content=
{`NODE_ENV=production && \
rm -rf build-component && \
mkdir build-component && \
npx babel src/Component --out-dir build-component --copy-files`} />
        <Typography>
        This build command requires us to install a new babel dependency, which is not included with CRA by default.
        </Typography>
        <Highlight language="bash"  content=
{`npm install --save-dev @babel/cli`} />
        <Typography>
        <br/>
        Next, add the line <b>"/build-component"</b> to the <b>.gitignore</b> file.<br/>
        Then, make a new file <b>.npmignore</b> with contents copied from <b>.gitignore</b>.<br/>
        Append these additional lines inside <b>.npmignore</b>:<br/>
        </Typography>
        <Highlight language="markdown"  content=
{`## Additioanl lines for npmignore
/public/
/src/
.travis.yml
.eslintcache
README.md
/build
!/build-component`} />
        <Typography>
        This step reduces the package size of our component on NPM. Our package should only include the <b>/build-component</b> folder.<br/>
        However, we can further reduce package size by examining our default CRA dependencies.<br/>
        Some CRA dependencies are unnecessary for our component package.<br/>
        Move all dependencies <b>except "react"</b> from <b>package.json/dependencies</b> to <b>package.json/devDependencies</b>.
        This allows us to release a small production package for our component, while maintaining the ability to develop our demo app.<br/>
        <br/>
        We're all done setting up our CRA application, and are ready to start developing.
        <br/>
        </Typography>
        <br/>
        <Typography variant="h4">Our Component</Typography>
        <Typography>
        Our component will be a simple grey background overly.<br/>
        Create a new file <b>"src/Component/index.js"</b> and paste the following code:
        </Typography>
        <Highlight language="jsx"  content=
{`import React from 'react';

const BackgroundGrey = (props) => (
    <div style={{ backgroundColor: "grey" }}>{props.children}</div>
)

export default BackgroundGrey`} />
        <Typography>
        Now in <b>App.js</b>, we write code to demonstration our new component.
        </Typography>
        <Highlight language="jsx" content=
{`import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import BackgroundGrey from "./Component"

function App() {
  return (
    <BackgroundGrey>
        <p>Hello World</p>
    </BackgroundGrey>
  );
}

export default App;`} />
        <Typography>
        We must also fix the default tests in <b>App.test.js</b>, like so...
        </Typography>
        <Highlight language="jsx"  content=
{`import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('renders learn react link', () => {
  render(<App />);
  const linkElement = screen.getByText(/Hello World/i);
  expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});`} />
        <Typography>
        Our component is now ready to test and run.
        </Typography>
        <Highlight language="bash" content=
{`npm install;
npm run test;
npm run start;`} />
        <br/>
        <Typography variant="h4">CI/CD: Travis</Typography>
        <Typography>
        Deployment of any production code needs to start with CI/CD. 
        For this guide I will assume your project is hosted via GitHub and integrated with Travis.
        Travis will package, test, and deploy to NPM.
        GitHub Pages will host our demonstration code into a live working site, which can be added to the README for instructional purposes. <br/>
        <br/>
        All this can be accomplished with the follow <b>.travis.yml</b> file
        </Typography>
        <Highlight language="yaml" content=
{`language: bash

    on:

after_deploy:

        <Typography>
        Key features to highlight include the usage of two <b>deploy</b> commands, one for NPM and one for GitHub Pages. Also the usage of two build <b>script</b>.
        Also notable, is our usage of <b>docker</b>, which allows us to ensure a consistent build environment for our source.
        Variables must be set in your CI/CD environment for: <b>NPM_TOKEN</b> and <b></b>
        <br/>
        </Typography>
        <br/>
        <Typography variant="h4">Publish to NPM</Typography>
        <Typography>
        Once you're ready to publish, simply merge your dev/feature branch into the <b>main</b> branch. Travis will kick off a build and deploy. And you can check your configured NPM registry.<br/>
        <br/>
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="h4">That's All!</Typography>
        <Typography>
        Hope this has been helpful! If you have many related components, you can include them into this same package.<br/>
        However you may also want to consider adapting a more scalable enterprise strategy using 3rd party component libraries: <Link href='https://bit.dev/' target="_blank">bit.dev</Link>
